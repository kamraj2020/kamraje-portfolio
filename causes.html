There are numerous causes of air pollution that makes the air
unhealthy and dangerous for the people, not just humans but 
also affects birds and plants.    To start off one of the
most reckless causes is man-made sources that contribute to 
the contamination of air. 
Man-made causes are things that humans do or create which 
now affects the environment. Man-made sources:

*Fossil Fuels Emissions

    <p>How does this affect humans:
Air pollution can cause a lot of lifelong illness and health 
effects on humans. If the  air we are breathing in  is unsafe
and toxic, it will definitely affect our respiratory system.
